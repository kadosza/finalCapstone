## 1. Project description:
The dataset contains data on murder, assault and rape made per 100,000 residents as well as percent of the population living in urban areas for 50 states in the US in 1973. The aim of this report is to analyse how data samples cluster together and how each crime type relates to each state using PCA and clustering methods.

* **Identifying best clustering method using k-means and hierarchical clustering**
* **Final data separation into clusters based on the most optimal parameters**
* **Explanation of relationships and final conclusions**
